// A vertical-text chapter, backed by an on-SD page cache.
//
// Memory model: pages are NEVER all held in RAM. On an ESP32-C3 (~220KB usable heap) a single
// real Japanese chapter (~30k characters) would need ~1.3MB of laid-out VerticalGlyphs -- the
// original hold-everything design only ever worked in the desktop emulator's 8MB heap. Instead:
//   - createSectionFile() streams: XML parse feeds paragraphs directly into layout, and each
//     batch of laid-out pages is serialized to the cache file immediately and freed.
//   - loadSectionFile() reads only the header + a per-page offset table (4 bytes/page).
//   - getPage() loads the one requested page from SD on demand into a single-page cache.

  // is invalidated by the next getPage() call for a different index -- all existing callers
  // fetch-and-render one page at a time, never holding two pages.
  //
  // NOT thread-safe, and the slot is shared by BOTH tasks: the render task re-faults it from
  // render()'s prewarm and image-warm tail (seconds long), the main task from the menu / word
  // lookup / bookmark paths. Faulting a page mutates this one std::vector<VerticalGlyph>, so a
  // concurrent pair of getPage() calls frees the glyph buffer under the other task -- observed
  // as a heap_caps_free panic ("target pointer is outside heap areas") on the NEXT clear().
