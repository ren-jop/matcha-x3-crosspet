// v51: bumped again past every v50 cache -- confirmed on a real device that v50's retry logic ran
// correctly (logged "removing partial cache file" for several broken images) but several STILL
// failed extraction on that same rebuild pass: the zip inflate's 32KB contiguous block was
// competing with the font decompressor's hot-group buffer, still resident from this same
// chapter's column-fitting text measurements. Now frees that buffer immediately before each image
// extraction attempt. A chapter rebuilt under v50 can have images that failed even with the retry
// logic and are now stuck cached as "extraction already tried, still missing" until a fresh
// rebuild gives the fix (more headroom, not just a retry) a chance to actually help. See cache
// format comment below.
// v52: not a format change -- forces a rebuild of vertical caches that were built while the CSS
// rule table was still held resident (see Epub::load): its heap fragmentation made the layout's
// stream reserve fail on long chapters, silently truncating them into sparse pages ON DISK.
// v78: PR #12 (rotated-run loop fix) also fixed encodeCp for supplementary-plane codepoints
// (4-byte UTF-8; previously emitted invalid 3-byte sequences) WITHOUT a bump -- caches built
// before it can hold the broken bytes and must not be reused.
// v80: not a format change -- invalidates best-effort caches built while the resident write
// staging buffer deepened the low-heap dips and dropped glyphs (missing characters ON DISK);
// the transient per-page staging buffer now prevents those drops on rebuild. (The
// early-first-render / mid-build page-turn work layered on top changes no on-disk format, so
// it needs no further bump -- a v80 cache built by this firmware is byte-identical.)
// v99: merge of upstream 1.5.0. Not a format change -- an invalidation. Upstream reworked the
// measurement stack the vertical layout is built on (SD kern classes + ligatures, the advance-table
// fast path, fallback-resolved text font ids), so a v98 cache's stored glyph positions no longer
// match the cell verticalCellPx() re-derives at DRAW time from the new metrics --
// the exact "cell flapping" mismatch that path exists to prevent. The horizontal pipeline
// invalidates for the same reason (SECTION_FILE_VERSION 51); this one must not be forgotten.
// v100: image pages carry their source href.
// v101: image pages built while extraction was failing stored the VIEWPORT box as the image size
// (the displayW/displayH fallback when getDimensions fails). config.useExactDimensions stretches
// the decode to exactly that box, so those pages rendered visibly distorted once the image finally
// became available. Extraction is reliable now (dee87656), so a rebuild records true dimensions.
// v102: aside/figure/figcaption joined isBlockTag (parity with the horizontal parser's
// SECTION_FILE_VERSION 68 bump), so kakomi boxes and figure blocks on those tags now break
// paragraphs and pick up styled-block params. A v101 cache flowed them as inline text.
// v103: no format change -- bumped so every vertical cache re-paginates once with the
// partial-reserve fix, replacing pages that older builds split at random fill levels
// under X3 heap pressure (no manual .crosspoint deletion needed).
// v104: glyph records are fixed-size (textId) with a per-page text pool appended after
// the glyph array; ruby/run strings moved out of VerticalGlyph (~3x smaller page buffers).
// v105: the header includes the vertical column-spacing setting.
// v131: bordered blocks render at all, and their geometry changed with them. No format change.
// CssPropertyFlags::anySet() omitted `border`, so every border-only rule (the EBPAJ `.k-*` set)
// was dropped at parse time and no kakomi box ever recorded a rect. Alongside that: rects are
// inset 0.25em from the text, boxed columns end short of the foot to leave room for the bottom
// rule, and a bordered block is separated from both neighbours by a blank column -- so
// pagination inside and around a box changes too. (127-130 were consumed by intermediate box
// geometries during development; caches carrying those numbers must not be trusted.)
// v134: every page record begins with the source position of its first character
// (VerticalPage::visibleTextOffset), counted the same way the horizontal parser counts it. It is
// what lets a vertical/horizontal switch resolve the reading position by content instead of by
// proportion. Format change: a v131 record starts with the image flag. (132-133 were consumed
// during development by builds that computed those positions wrongly; such records parse cleanly,
// so caches carrying those numbers must not be trusted.)
// v135: bold/italic/bouten now END where their element ends. The close compared the opening
// elementDepth against an already-decremented one, so a style was never popped and ran to the end
// of the chapter -- most visibly a <span class="em-sesame"> putting sesame marks on every
// character after it. Cached pages carry the marks and the pagination they caused.
