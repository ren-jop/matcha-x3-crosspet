# File Formats

These formats describe the SD-card cache files under `/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/`.
All POD fields are written in the ESP32 little-endian representation used by
`Serialization.h`; strings are length-prefixed UTF-8.

## `book.bin`

### Version 10

`book.bin` stores EPUB metadata plus lookup tables for spine and TOC entries.
The current firmware writes this version from `BookMetadataCache`.

ImHex pattern:

## `section.bin`

### Version 94 (fork numbering)

Carries upstream's v45 to v48. Internal EPUB links keep CSS superscript and
subscript positioning; ordered lists number their items and
`list-style-type: none` suppresses markers; the section header gains signed
`characterSpacing` (pixels) and unsigned `wordSpacingPercent`, both part of cache
validation, with each TextBlock's BlockStyle storing only `characterSpacing`; and
Hangul no longer has implicit break opportunities between syllables — Korean
wraps at spaces, justification stretches word spaces only, and with hyphenation
enabled a word may split where the CJK line-breaking rules allow, without an
inserted hyphen. The header grew and line breaking moved, so v93 caches neither
parse nor match.

### Version 92 (fork numbering)

Each file in `sections/*.bin` stores one laid-out spine section. The header is
also the cache-busting key: if any layout-affecting setting differs from the
current reader settings, the section is discarded and rebuilt.

Version 92 keeps the version 91 framing unchanged. A drop cap is now sized
against the vertical advance the lines beside it are actually emitted with —
the reader's line-spacing factor and the block's CSS `line-height` — instead of
the font's raw leading. Under tighter leading the enlarged letter came out
taller than the column it reserved, so it ran through the first full-width line
below the reserved lines. The reserved column and the opening lines' breaks
change with it, so cached sections must be rebuilt.

Version 91 keeps the version 90 framing unchanged. Only the geometry stored in
`PageBox` changes: a bordered block's closing edge is no longer allowed above
the bottom of the last line inside it. The edge is still pulled up toward the
text to absorb trailing block spacing, but a block carrying little or none used
to have that pull-up land inside the final line's glyphs, drawing the border
through the text. Because the box height is computed at build time and stored,
existing caches keep the old geometry and must be rebuilt — hence the version
bump rather than a pure code fix.

Version 90 kept the version 89 framing unchanged. An inline `font-size`
that the built-in font ladder cannot serve — a single-size SD-card reader font
has no 12/14/16/18pt siblings to snap to — is now honoured by scaling the
glyph bitmap instead of being dropped, at a scale snapped to an eighth. The
per-word font slot carries that scale as a negative tag rather than a font id.
`<small>` runs that previously rendered at body size are now narrower, so any
line containing one breaks and positions differently.

Version 89 extends the drop cap trailer with the opening mark's codepoint
(u32, zero when there is none), so the record is 4 bytes longer than version
88's and the two framings are not interchangeable. Punctuation a paragraph
opens with before its initial — the em dash of a French chapter opening —
now leaves the text flow together with the letter and is drawn at body size
immediately left of it. Left in the flow it appeared to the *right* of the
initial, because the flow begins where the reserved column ends.

Version 88 keeps the version 85 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because the initial no longer has to be the paragraph's first token: a French
chapter opening (`—&#160;<span class="let">L</span>…`) tokenizes the em dash
and the no-break space ahead of the lettrine, and those paragraphs now get the
reserved column and reflowed opening lines as well.

Version 87 keeps the version 85 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because a paragraph opened by an enlarged single-letter span
(`<p><span class="lettrine">L</span>…`) is now treated as an initial as well,
which is how many trade EPUBs mark a drop cap up instead of using a
pseudo-element at all. Those paragraphs gain the reserved column and the
reflowed opening lines a version 86 cache was built without.

Version 86 keeps the version 85 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because the drop cap selector is now also recognised in its CSS 2.1 one-colon
spelling (`p:first-letter`, alongside `p::first-letter`), so a book written
that way gains drop caps — and with them the reserved column and the reflowed
opening lines a version 85 cache was built without.

Version 85 extends each text block's record with a drop cap trailer — the
enlarged letter's codepoint (u32), its ink origin relative to the block (two
i16), its glyph magnification (u8) and the face it is drawn in (u8, bits 0-1),
all zero on the lines that have none.
The layout changes with it: a paragraph whose stylesheet declares
`::first-letter { font-size: ... }` at 2x or more now takes that letter out of
the text flow and reserves a column for it, so the opening lines are broken to
a narrower width and their words sit at new x positions.

Version 84 keeps the version 83 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because, in French books, a word ending in a hyphenated subject pronoun
("songeai-je", "pense-t-il", "dit-elle") is now split into extra word tokens
so the verb and the pronoun are each independently selectable for dictionary
lookup, while a lexicalized compound like "rendez-vous" stays one token. This
changes the token count and positions on any page cached under v83 that
contains such a word.

Version 83 merges upstream's v43 and v44 changes into the fork's format:
paragraph base direction no longer follows a direction change on an inline
element, and each serialized page now carries the internal-link rectangles the
reader uses for touch navigation. Older caches neither match the new line
positions nor parse the extended page body.

Version 81 merges upstream's v41 change into the fork's format: simple HTML
table rows are laid out as positioned columns rather than flattened paragraphs
with synthetic row/cell labels, so any cached page holding a table has the wrong
geometry.

Version 76 merges upstream's v37 change into the fork's format: the fixed-size
footnote href field grows from 96 to 256 bytes for long calibre paths, taking
each serialized footnote record from 128 to 288 bytes. Older section caches
cannot be read under the new framing and are rebuilt.

Version 75 is binary-identical to version 74. The version was bumped because a
`font-size` on `<html>` or `<body>` is no longer applied to layout: it restates
the base text size, and the reader's own font already *is* that base (every
declaration resolves against it), so applying it sized whole books away from the
user's setting. Pages cached by v74 hold the publisher-sized layout.

Version 41 keeps the version 40 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because simple HTML table rows are now laid out as positioned columns rather
than flattened paragraphs with synthetic row/cell labels.

Version 40 keeps the version 39 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby groups now remain intact when large text blocks are soft-flushed.

Version 39 keeps the version 38 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because image top margins are now clamped to keep full-height images within the
page viewport.

Version 38 keeps the version 37 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because Focus Reading now permits line breaks at visible hyphens and dashes
and hyphenates focus-split words as a whole, changing cached page layout.

Version 37 increases the fixed-size footnote href field from 96 to 256 bytes.
This changes each serialized footnote record from 128 to 288 bytes, so older
section caches must be discarded and rebuilt.

Version 36 keeps the version 35 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby and justified text positioning and CJK line breaking now use
corrected word measurements, so version 35 cached page layouts no longer match.

Version 70 merges upstream's v35 change into the fork's format: the header
gains a fifth `uint32_t` offset and a `uint32_t` entry per page for the
visible-text offset LUT. The fork additionally appends a section-wide footnote
table whose offset sits in the file's final 4 bytes. The other section LUTs
remain unchanged.

Version 34 is binary-identical to version 33. The version was bumped because
word-gap suppression was narrowed to tokens glued together in the source: v33
dropped the gap between any two words meeting at a CJK break opportunity, which
collapsed the spaces between Hangul words, so v33 word positions no longer match
what the layout engine now produces.

Version 30 is binary-identical to version 29. The version was bumped because
Arabic contextual shaping changed text measurement (`getTextAdvanceX` now
measures the shaped visual text), so word positions cached by v29 no longer
match what `drawText` renders.

Version 28 introduced serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough,
superscript, and subscript. The format also includes:

- cache-busting fields for paragraph alignment, hyphenation, embedded CSS,
  image rendering mode, and Focus Reading
- page offset LUT
- per-page visible-text offset LUT (zero-based Unicode codepoints in `<body>`)
- anchor-to-page map for fragment and footnote navigation
- paragraph and list-item LUTs retained for navigation and legacy sync fallback
- optional per-word Focus Reading split metadata
- per-page footnote entries
- serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and
  subscript
- flat TextBlock word storage (v29): per-word arrays plus one shared
  NUL-terminated text blob, replacing v28's length-prefixed word strings. The
  on-disk order mirrors the in-RAM arena so the firmware reads a whole block
  payload with a single allocation and a single SD read

## `ruby.bin`

Per-book furigana glossary: unique `(base text, ruby reading)` pairs harvested from
`<ruby>` markup during section parsing (both horizontal and vertical builds). Word
lookup consults it so "In this book: <reading>" can be shown for later, bare-kanji
occurrences of a word whose reading the book annotated only on first appearance.

Location: `.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/ruby.bin`. Unlike section caches the pairs depend
only on book content — never on font, margins, or viewport — so the file survives
relayouts and is only removed with the book's cache directory.

Current version: **1**

```text
u8   version        (1)
u16  count          (little-endian, capped at 1024 records)
repeated count times:
  u8   baseLen      (1..32)
  u8[] baseText     (UTF-8, baseLen bytes, no terminator)
  u8   rubyLen      (1..32)
  u8[] rubyText     (UTF-8, rubyLen bytes, no terminator)
```

Only kanji-bearing base texts are stored. The file is capped at 16KB; overflow pairs
are silently dropped (the glossary is best-effort). Distinct readings for the same
base text may appear as separate records; lookup joins them with '・'.

## LIBX — cover grid index (`.crosspoint/covers.idx`)

Written and read by `src/activities/library/CoverLibraryActivity.cpp`, for the Matcha Covers
library view. One fixed-size record per book seen by a previous scan, so a visit can skip the
file open per EPUB and the directory listing per manga folder that checking for a cover costs.
Carries no titles or paths: those already live in the persisted recents list.

Distinct from the CLX1 index below, which serves the CrossPoint list view. The two views keep
separate indexes and separate filenames — sharing a path means each write destroys the other's
index, so both rebuild on every switch between the views.

`"LIBX"` magic, `uint8_t` version (currently 3), `uint32_t` entry count (rejected above 2048),
then that many 15-byte records: `pathHash` (`uint32_t`), `fileSize` (`uint32_t`, the size of
`panels.idx` for a manga folder), `modifiedStamp` (`uint32_t`, packed FAT date/time, 0 when the
driver has none), `thumbHeight` (`uint16_t`, the cover height the thumbnail was verified for),
and `flags` (`uint8_t`: bit 0 a verified thumbnail is present, bit 1 the book declares no cover).
A mismatched magic, version or count is treated as no index at all and the scan runs in full.

## CLX1 — library index (`.crosspoint/library.idx`)

Written by `lib/LibraryIndex/LibraryBuilder.cpp`, read by `LibraryIndexFile`. One
file describing every book on the card, so the shelf can sort and search
thousands of titles without opening any of them.

Format version 2. An index written by another version fails validation on open
and is rebuilt; that is the entire migration mechanism.

### Layout

| Section | Offset | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Header | 0 | 64 bytes, `ClixHeader` |
| Folders | `folderStart` | length-prefixed paths, one per folder |
| Records | `recordStart` | `bookCount` × 128-byte `ClixRecord` |
| Permutations | `permStart` | `bookCount` u16 author order, then `bookCount` u16 arrival order |
| Name blob | `nameStart` | per record: path hash, name, canonical author, title, source author (see below) |

The arrival permutation runs oldest first, keyed by the record's FAT
modification time (when the file landed on the card); `firstSeen` — the
build-assigned discovery counter — breaks ties and carries books whose
filesystem reports no time. Fold version 3 introduced the timestamp key; a
fold bump rebuilds ranks while preserving `firstSeen`.
Fold version 4 preserves leading articles in title sort and search keys.

Sections are 512-byte aligned so each starts on an SD block boundary.

### Records are exactly 128 bytes

A fixed stride is what lets the reader seek straight to record *n* without an
offset table, and read a screenful in one 4 KB block. `static_assert` enforces it.

Each record carries `fold[96]`, the title normalised for search and sorting —
accents stripped, case dropped, leading articles preserved — and `authorKey[12]`,
the author's words folded and sorted so that "Victor Hugo" and "Hugo Victor" group as
one person. `authorKey` is a GROUPING key, not an ordering one: the shelf orders by
surname, derived separately from the display name.

The byte before the folded title records metadata extraction status: not
attempted, extracted, or failed. The final four bytes contain the packed FAT
modification date and time returned by SdFat. A zero timestamp is not trusted.
These fields occupy the alignment and reserved bytes from version 1, so the
record remains exactly 128 bytes.

The header records whether EPUB metadata extraction was enabled for the build.
This prevents a metadata-disabled rebuild from making filename fallbacks look
fresh to a later metadata-enabled build.

### The name blob

Per record, at `nameStart + nameOff`:

```text
[u64 pathHash]    FNV-1a fingerprint of the complete path
[nameLen bytes]  filename, without the directory
[u8][author]     display author, one spelling chosen per authorKey across the library
[u8][title]      the book's own title, or length 0 if it never gave one
[u8][source]     cleaned author spelling before the library-wide spelling vote
```

The filename must stay the first textual field and stay the filename: `readPath`
rebuilds a book's path from it, so writing the display title there makes the book
impossible to open. That was a real defect, and it is why title has its own field.

The source author is separate from the displayed canonical author so a later
rebuild can repeat the spelling vote after books are added or removed. Existing
display reads still stop at the author or title fields and retain their offsets.

### Freshness and unchanged rebuilds

Reconciliation treats the persisted 64-bit complete-path fingerprint as the
book identity. Metadata is reused only when the fingerprint, size, nonzero FAT
timestamp, fold version, metadata mode, and expected extraction status agree.
EPUBs with a zero timestamp or a previous extraction failure are parsed again.

If every current record reuses metadata, the old and new counts agree, and no
unreadable entry was seen, the staging files are discarded and the live index is
left byte-for-byte unchanged. A normal rebuild action is therefore a freshness
check, not a forced metadata reread.

### Header flags

`RANKS_DEGRADED` says one or more orders fell back to walk order because a
checked sort allocation failed. Title and author each use a phase-local
`SortKey[bookCount]` allocation (14 bytes per book, 57,344 bytes at the 4,096-book
format ceiling); the first array is released before the second is requested.
Sorting is therefore best effort through the full format limit rather than
being disabled at an arbitrary library size.

`DEDUP_DEGRADED` says a directory exceeded the fixed 1024-entry duplicate-key
buffer, or that its fallible 8 KiB allocation failed. The walk still indexes
every enumerated book; it only stops remembering additional identities for
duplicate-dirent detection, so a damaged FAT may expose duplicates but cannot
make a real book disappear.

`selfSize` is the expected file size. Comparing it against the real one is a free
truncation guard: a build cut short by a power failure cannot pass.
