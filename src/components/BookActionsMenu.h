// The long-press menu on a book cover, shared by the Library grid and the Home cover grid so the
// gesture means the same thing in both. Stats, the read/unread switch, and delete; the switch
// offers only the direction that would change anything, so a finished book has no "Mark as read"
// and an unopened one has no "Mark as unread".
//
// The host owns the OptionPopup (it has to render it) and passes it in. `onChanged` runs after an
// action that altered the book -- marked, or deleted -- so the host can reload its list; `deleted`
// says which of the two it was, since a deleted book must not be left in the caller's arrays.
